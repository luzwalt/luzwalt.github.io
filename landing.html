    <h1> Glossier <3’s Olivia. </h1>
    <p>If you don’t know Olivia Rodrigo, pause here and go listen to <strong> <a href="https://oliviarodrigo.lnk.to/good4uWE">“good 4 u.”</a> </strong> Not only is she on all our HQ playlists,
      she’s a three-time 2022 GRAMMY® Award Winner, Time’s 2021 Entertainer of the Year and Billboard’s 2022 Woman of the Year. <p>
        <br>
      </p>And in case you’ve been wondering, Olivia shared her secret to becoming an expert at her signature cat eye.
      “I just try to do it every day, and statistically, I have to have improved at least a little.”
      <br>
      <p>That’s the beauty of beauty:
        embracing “mistakes” (really, there are none), and enjoying wherever you are on your beauty journey … because you look good!</p>

          <p>Delving into someone’s beauty philosophy is our favorite way to get to know them on a ‘just them and their bathroom mirror’
            level. So, we had to ask Olivia about how she views beauty…</p> </strong>

            <p>“The way I feel best is when I’m in makeup that accentuates my natural features and makes me glowy– when it enhances what I have naturally.”</p>

            <p>Like many of us, Olivia is still figuring out what works, what doesn’t, and is finding her own voice in beauty. “Before, I’d let people do the craziest things,
              like hot pink lipstick and crazy eyelashes. But as I grow, I learn what I feel comfortable in, and I’m willing to advocate for that.”</p>

              <p>Olivia gave us her desert island beauty must-haves, which are available together in our latest set.
                “I love a good eyebrow, a winged eyeliner,” says Olivia (as do we). Plus, a little shine and color for your lips,
                to complete Olivia’s look.</p>

                  who likes to take care of herself and people around her.
                  That always looks good–when you're taking care of yourself on the inside.”</h1>
